# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Description
This project implements various reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically focusing on the multi-armed bandit problem. The algorithms included are the Epsilon-Greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Epsilon-Greedy
The Epsilon-Greedy algorithm is a simple and effective strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation. It selects a random bandit with a probability of epsilon and the best-performing bandit otherwise.

### Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
The UCB algorithm selects bandits based on their success ratios and a confidence interval, allowing for a more informed exploration strategy.

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `epsilon greedy` and `ucb` folders.
3. Run the cells to execute the algorithms and observe the results.

## Results
The results of the experiments demonstrate the performance of each algorithm under different conditions, highlighting the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation.
